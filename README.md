# Schoool_District_Analysis

# Overview of Project
  The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate the statistics of both student success rates as well as the overall infrastructure of multiple school systems with a 
  focus on Thomas Highschool's students. The had a focus on 'THS' freshman in terms of their math and reading scores while later on, it combined the grades 10-12 to
  help create an overal picture of the school's success rate. In relation to the schools, this project also evaluated a school system's budget in relation to the 
  students succes in class. 
  
# Metrcs
    In terms of the individual school's metrics, this project had a focus on : 'Total School Budget", 'Per Student Budget', 'Average Math Score', 'Average Reading 
    Score', '% passing math', '% passing reading' and lastly the % of students that are overall passing. Other factors such as the type of school and the amount of 
    students were factored in, but the main focus did hone in on the first seven categories. When it comes to the topic of the total budget, the schols that did spend 
    the most have a correlation to having the lowest succes rate out of the entire data pool. In comparison, the schools that did have the high budgets did also have a 
    higher student population which would create a correlation between the amount of tax money / tuiton the school system would recieve which in turn would allow for 
    these budgest to exist. The class sizes could also play a factor in a students success rate because it can allow for more of a personal learning experience and 
    can foster an environment for them to succeed compared to the bigger schools. 
    When looking at the data,the top five schools all share a common school type by being charter schools. These programs have significantly smaller class sizes 
    compared to the bottom five which are all district schools that all average about 3,800 students. The sheer size of these schools show that they are not as 
    successful in terms of providing an environment for students to pass considering they all sit around a 50% passing rate with math scores being in the 66% in terms 
    of passing. By comparison the five chartger schools all have about a 90% passing rate with both math and reading score percentages sitting around the 94-95% passing.
    
# Summary
  When looking at both sets of data, in the new data set, there is a clear difference between a charter school vs a district school. Although they may not have the 
  highest budget, these schools have a higher success rate. Even when comparinng the old data, the charter schools have shown that with smallger budgets and student
  populations, they are able to stay ahead of the district schools. When looking at the success rates by grade many factors can be taken into consideration, and
  when it comes to the averages by grade, at a glance, the 10th graders as a whole seem to have the higher passing percentages. This can show a change in learning
  habits when adjusting into highschool compared to seniors that are ready to graduate or freshman that are trying to get used to being in highschool. Overall, the 
  data shows that different highschool sizes/budgets do affect the student's succes as highschoolers and with the smaller schools being successful, it shows that
  smaller class sizes can be more beneficial. 
  In terms of setting up the code and working through this project, figuring out how to subsititute in the Thomas Highschool was a challenge. It took a few tries, as 
  well as a couple of moments that stumped me but overall within the first deliverable, I was able to set up a functioning code to complete that section. In
  deliverable two, I used part of the weekly assignment to help cross reference any issues I might have had but did run into a major one when it came down to setting 
  up the passingpercentages. All of them would be able to run but then I would see that there were no values present. However, when I created the table, there were 
  values within thatchart that showed the values that I needed to output within the previous cells. Overall, the project was challenging however, did help me with 
  practing how to recognize changes within the datasets over multiple factors and variables; and allowed me to practice creating different functions within pandas.
